# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-13
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

Build a web application that helps users solve Wordle puzzles by suggesting optimal words based on their guesses and color-coded feedback. Starting with a solid foundation and word list, we implemented constraint-based filtering, intelligent ranking algorithms, and a clean input interface that mirrors Wordle's visual feedback system.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Establish project structure, configure tooling, and create a comprehensive 5-letter word list with supporting data structures
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding and word list integration

**Details:**
- Vite + TypeScript project with strict mode enabled
- 2,399-word Wordle list (exceeds 2,309 official solutions)
- Core domain types: LetterStatus, LetterFeedback, GuessFeedback, Constraints
- Vanilla TypeScript (no React/Vue) - sufficient for app complexity

### Phase 2: Core Logic

**Goal**: Implement the constraint engine that filters words based on green/yellow/gray feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Constraint modeling and word filtering

**Details:**
- createEmptyConstraints, addGuessToConstraints, filterWords functions
- Immutable constraint updates (returns new object)
- requiredLetters precedence over excludedLetters for duplicate letters
- Filter checks ordered by efficiency: exact positions → excluded → required

### Phase 3: Ranking System

**Goal**: Score and rank remaining words by letter frequency and strategic value for information gain
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Letter frequency scoring
- [x] 03-02: Information gain ranking

**Details:**
- simulateFeedback() for Wordle feedback simulation
- calculateExpectedRemaining() and calculateEntropy() for information theory
- rankWords() with auto-mode selection (>500 words uses frequency-only)
- Unique letter scoring rewards word diversity

### Phase 4: User Interface

**Goal**: Build the color-coded input interface and word suggestions display
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 4 plans (2 planned + 2 FIX)

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Input interface for guess entry and color marking
- [x] 04-02: Suggestions display and interaction
- [x] 04-FIX: Real-time filtering model and editing fixes
- [x] 04-FIX2: Prefix filtering and focus recovery

**Details:**
- 6x5 grid with keyboard navigation and click-to-color
- Event delegation for efficient click handling
- Top 20 suggestions with score percentage and visual bars
- Top 3 highlighted for visibility
- Real-time filtering via onChange callback
- Cross-row backspace for free editing

### Phase 5: Polish

**Goal**: Refine UX, handle edge cases, optimize performance, and ensure reliable puzzle-solving
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Dark theme, animations, and invalid word feedback

**Details:**
- Wordle's exact color palette (#121213, #538d4e, #b59f3b, #3a3a3c)
- 100ms pop animation for letter feedback
- 300ms shake animation for invalid words
- Smooth 0.15s color transitions

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

None - all phases were planned from the start.

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Vanilla TypeScript (no React/Vue) — Rationale: App complexity doesn't warrant a framework
- Decision: Word list as const array (~50KB) — Rationale: Acceptable file size, no fetch needed
- Decision: Immutable constraint updates — Rationale: Clear state management
- Decision: Auto-mode ranking (>500 words uses frequency-only) — Rationale: Performance
- Decision: Event delegation for clicks — Rationale: Single listener more efficient
- Decision: Real-time filtering on every keystroke — Rationale: Better UX than submit-based
- Decision: Wordle's exact color palette — Rationale: Authentic look and feel

**Issues Resolved:**

- Initial focus issues when clicking outside grid
- Row editing limitations (backspace across rows)
- Filtering not updating until submit (changed to real-time)
- Click outside grid not recovering focus (added document click handler)

**Issues Deferred:**

None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - clean implementation.
