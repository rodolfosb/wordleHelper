## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

None - all phases were planned from the start.

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Use vite-plugin-pwa with autoUpdate registration — Rationale: Zero-config PWA setup
- Decision: Embed historical Wordle answers in bundle — Rationale: Avoid CORS issues with NYT/WordleHints APIs
- Decision: CSS custom properties for theming — Rationale: Runtime theme switching without reload
- Decision: Two-pass color algorithm (greens first, then yellows) — Rationale: Match Wordle's exact behavior
- Decision: Display-only keyboard (not clickable) — Rationale: Avoid scope creep
- Decision: Stats persist across sessions — Rationale: Reset Game doesn't clear cumulative stats

**Issues Resolved:**

- CORS blocking when fetching from NYT/WordleHints APIs (fixed by embedding data)
- Date picker stealing keyboard focus (fixed with proper blur/focus management)
- Sparse puzzle data breaking practice mode (fixed by expanding to 1,671 puzzles)
- Missing recent answers for Jan 12-15, 2026 (added GRACE, OXIDE, SCREW, SEVER)

**Issues Deferred:**

None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - clean implementation.
