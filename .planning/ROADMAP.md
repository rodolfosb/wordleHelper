# Roadmap: Wordle Helper

## Overview

Build a web application that helps users solve Wordle puzzles by suggesting optimal words based on their guesses and color-coded feedback. Starting with a solid foundation and word list, we'll implement constraint-based filtering, intelligent ranking algorithms, and a clean input interface that mirrors Wordle's visual feedback system.
