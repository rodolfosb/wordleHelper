<objective>
Restructure app layout with header navigation bar and visual focus on puzzle/keyboard.

Purpose: Transform the header from ad-hoc button placement to a proper navigation bar with Stats, How-to-play, Settings, and Language icons. Center the puzzle grid and keyboard as the primary visual elements. This creates the foundation for Phase 13 (Settings Menu) and Phase 18 (Internationalization).

Output: Redesigned header with icon-based navigation, cleaner layout with puzzle/keyboard as focal point.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure header with navigation bar</name>
  <files>src/main.ts, src/style.css</files>
  <action>
Redesign the header structure in main.ts:

1. **Header layout structure:**
   ```
   .app-header
   ├── .header-left (hamburger menu placeholder for mobile - hidden on desktop)
   ├── .header-center
   │   ├── h1 "Wordle" (or keep "Wordle Helper")
   │   └── .header-subtitle (puzzle number/date)
   └── .header-right (navigation icons)
       ├── Help icon (question mark - How-to-play)
       ├── Stats icon (bar chart - existing)
       ├── Settings icon (gear - placeholder for Phase 13)
       └── Language icon (globe - placeholder for Phase 18)
   ```

2. **Icon buttons in header-right:**
   - Reuse existing stats button and its SVG icon
   - Add Help button with question mark SVG icon (material icon style to match existing)
   - Add Settings button with gear SVG icon (placeholder - opens nothing yet)
   - Add Language button with globe SVG icon (placeholder - opens nothing yet)

3. **Move/remove elements:**
   - Move theme toggle button into Settings menu (Phase 13) - for now, KEEP it but move to end of header-right
   - Remove practice button from header - it stays (users access practice via date picker triggered from somewhere else later)
   - Actually, KEEP practice button for now - it's the only way to access practice mode

4. **Icon order (left to right):**
   Help | Stats | Practice (calendar) | Settings (gear) | Language (globe) | Theme toggle

5. **CSS updates in style.css:**
   - .app-header: Use flexbox with space-between, align-items center
   - .header-left, .header-center, .header-right: Flex children with proper sizing
   - .header-center: flex: 1, text-align center
   - .header-right: display flex, gap between icons
   - Icon buttons: consistent sizing (40x40px touch target), circular hover state
   - Mobile: header compresses nicely, icons stay visible

Note: The Help, Settings, and Language buttons are PLACEHOLDERS - they don't open anything yet. Just add the buttons with appropriate aria-labels and titles. This phase is about the layout structure, not functionality.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, no TypeScript errors</verify>
  <done>Header displays with all navigation icons in a row, subtitle shows puzzle info, layout uses flexbox properly</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Optimize layout with puzzle/keyboard as focal point</name>
  <files>src/main.ts, src/style.css</files>
  <action>
Adjust the main content area layout:

1. **Remove or reposition Reset Game button:**
   - The "Reset Game" button above the grid takes up valuable space
   - Option A: Move it below the keyboard
   - Option B: Make it smaller/less prominent
   - Choose Option A: Move Reset Game button BELOW the keyboard area
   - Update main.ts HTML structure: remove from .controls div, add after .keyboard-area

2. **Adjust spacing:**
   - Reduce header margin-bottom from 1.5rem to 1rem
   - Reduce gap between grid and suggestions
   - Ensure keyboard has adequate spacing from edges

3. **Content order in .app-main:**
   ```
   .app-main
   ├── .practice-indicator (shows when in practice mode)
   ├── .guess-grid (primary focus)
   ├── .game-message
   ├── .keyboard-area (secondary focus)
   ├── .controls (now contains Reset Game button - below keyboard)
   └── .suggestions-area (helper content at bottom)
   ```

4. **CSS tweaks:**
   - .guess-grid: margin-bottom adjustment for visual balance
   - .keyboard-area: ensure proper vertical spacing
   - .suggestions-area: slightly reduced prominence (smaller font? different bg?)
   - .controls: styled for below-keyboard position, maybe smaller button

5. **Keep everything functional** - this is layout only, no logic changes
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, app runs with npm run dev</verify>
  <done>Reset button is below keyboard, puzzle grid and keyboard are visually prominent, suggestions area is less prominent</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Restructured header with navigation icons and optimized layout with puzzle/keyboard focus</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:5173
    3. Check header:
       - Title/subtitle centered
       - Icons on right: Help (?), Stats (bars), Practice (calendar), Settings (gear), Language (globe), Theme (sun/moon)
       - All icons same size, consistent spacing
       - Hover states work on each icon
    4. Check layout:
       - Puzzle grid is prominent (visually centered, good size)
       - Keyboard below grid with good spacing
       - Reset Game button is below keyboard (less prominent)
       - Suggestions at bottom, less visually dominant
    5. Test mobile (resize to 375px width):
       - Header icons stay visible and tappable
       - Layout adjusts appropriately
       - No horizontal scroll
    6. Test dark/light mode toggle still works
