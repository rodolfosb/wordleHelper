# Phase 5: Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The Wordle Helper should look and feel like the real Wordle game - dark theme with the signature green/yellow/gray color scheme. But it should also feel modern and minimal, not cluttered.

Interactions should be smooth with animations and transitions - letters appearing, colors changing, suggestions updating. The app should feel polished and professional.

When edge cases happen (invalid words, no matches), it should handle them gracefully with clear feedback rather than just silently failing or looking broken.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual match to Wordle** - Dark theme, authentic green/yellow/gray colors, familiar grid appearance
- **Smooth animations** - Letter input, color transitions, and suggestions should animate smoothly
- **Graceful edge case handling** - Invalid word feedback, empty state messaging when no words match

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Social/sharing features - No share buttons, no copying results to clipboard
- Game variants - No hard mode, no alternative Wordle modes
- Mobile-specific optimization can wait (desktop-first is fine)

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Match Wordle's dark theme aesthetic
- Animations for letter entry (maybe subtle pop or scale)
- Color transitions when clicking cells
- Clear message when no words match the current constraints
- Visual feedback if user enters a non-dictionary word

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

All functional features are complete after Phase 4. This phase is about making the experience feel polished and handling the rough edges. The app should feel like a finished product, not a prototype.
