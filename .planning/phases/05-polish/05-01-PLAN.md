**User vision from CONTEXT.md:**
- Dark theme with signature green/yellow/gray colors matching real Wordle
- Smooth animations for letter input, color transitions, suggestions updating
- Graceful edge case handling (invalid words, no matches)

**Current state:**
- Functional app complete (input, filtering, ranking, suggestions)
- Basic dark theme exists but uses generic colors (#242424 background)
- No animations on interactions
- Partial edge case handling ("No matches found", "Answer found!")

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Apply authentic Wordle dark theme</name>
  <files>src/style.css, index.html</files>
  <action>
Update CSS to match Wordle's official color scheme:
- Background: #121213 (Wordle's dark background)
- Header/title area background: #121213
- Grid cell empty border: #3a3a3c (already correct)
- Cell with letter (no color yet): border #565758, background #121213
- Green: #538d4e (correct position) - currently #6aaa64, adjust
- Yellow: #b59f3b (wrong position) - currently #c9b458, adjust
- Gray: #3a3a3c (not in word) - currently #787c7e, adjust
- Text color: #ffffff throughout

Update index.html to add proper meta theme-color tag for mobile browsers.

Remove the light mode media queries (@media prefers-color-scheme: light) - app should always be dark mode to match Wordle.

Keep the suggestions panel dark colors (#1a1a1a) but adjust to fit theme.
  </action>
  <verify>Open app in dev mode, visually confirm dark theme matches Wordle aesthetic</verify>
  <done>App background is #121213, green/yellow/gray cells match Wordle's exact colors, no light mode fallback</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add smooth animations for interactions</name>
  <files>src/style.css, src/ui/GuessGrid.ts</files>
  <action>
Add CSS transitions and animations:

1. Letter input animation - when a letter is typed:
   - Scale up briefly (transform: scale(1.1)) then back to 1.0
   - CSS class .cell-pop with animation, apply/remove in updateCell()

2. Color transition - when clicking to change color:
   - Smooth background-color transition (0.15s ease)
   - Already have transition setup, ensure it's applied to background

3. Suggestions list fade - when suggestions update:
   - Brief opacity transition on .suggestions-list (0.1s)
   - Handled via CSS, no JS changes needed

4. Cell filled state - when cell has a letter but no color assigned yet:
   - Add .cell-filled class with border highlight (#565758)

Implementation notes:
- Use CSS keyframes for the pop animation (scale 1 -> 1.1 -> 1)
- Animation duration ~100ms for snappy feel
- In GuessGrid.updateCell(), add .cell-pop class when letter added, remove after animation ends
  </action>
  <verify>Type letters and see subtle pop animation, click cells to see smooth color transitions</verify>
  <done>Letters pop when typed, colors transition smoothly, no janky or abrupt visual changes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add invalid word feedback</name>
  <files>src/logic/filter.ts, src/ui/GuessGrid.ts, src/main.ts, src/style.css</files>
  <action>
Add validation feedback when user enters a word not in the dictionary:

1. In filter.ts, add `isValidWord(word: string): boolean` function that checks if word exists in WORD_LIST

2. In GuessGrid:
   - Add private method `shakeRow(row: number)` that adds/removes .row-shake class
   - Export method or provide callback mechanism for invalid word feedback

3. In main.ts onSubmit callback:
   - Before advancing to next row, check if current word is in WORD_LIST
   - If NOT valid: trigger shake animation on current row, do NOT advance
   - If valid: advance to next row as normal

4. In style.css:
   - Add .row-shake animation (horizontal shake, 3 quick shakes over ~300ms)
   - Use CSS keyframes: translateX(0) -> translateX(-5px) -> translateX(5px) -> translateX(0)

This matches Wordle's behavior where invalid guesses shake and don't submit.
  </action>
  <verify>Enter invalid 5-letter combination like "xxxxx", row should shake and not advance</verify>
  <done>Invalid words trigger shake animation, row doesn't advance, valid words advance normally</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Polished Wordle Helper with authentic dark theme, smooth animations, and invalid word feedback</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:5173
    3. Visual check: App should have dark Wordle-like background (#121213)
    4. Type "CRANE" - each letter should have a subtle pop animation
    5. Click cells to cycle colors - transitions should be smooth
    6. Type "XXXXX" and press Enter - row should shake, not advance
    7. Type "APPLE" and press Enter - row should advance (valid word)
    8. Overall: App should feel polished, like a finished product
