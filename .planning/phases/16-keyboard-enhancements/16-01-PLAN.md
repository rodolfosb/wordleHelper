<objective>
Verify that Enter and Backspace keys are already implemented on the on-screen keyboard.

Purpose: Phase 16's goal was to "Add Enter and Backspace keys to on-screen keyboard" - this was already implemented in Phase 12 (Header Layout) as part of making the keyboard clickable for mobile users. This plan verifies the functionality is complete.

Output: Verification that Phase 16 requirements are satisfied by existing implementation.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify Enter and Backspace keys exist in Keyboard.ts</name>
  <files>src/ui/Keyboard.ts</files>
  <action>
    Confirm the keyboard implementation includes:
    1. ROWS array with Enter and Backspace keys on row 3
    2. Render method creating `key-enter` and `key-backspace` elements
    3. Click handler that passes key presses to callback
    4. Backspace rendered with SVG icon
  </action>
  <verify>grep -n "Enter\|Backspace" src/ui/Keyboard.ts shows both keys in ROWS and render logic</verify>
  <done>Keyboard.ts contains Enter and Backspace key definitions and rendering</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify keyboard click handlers are connected</name>
  <files>src/main.ts</files>
  <action>
    Confirm main.ts connects keyboard clicks to grid input:
    1. keyboard.onKeyPress() callback is set
    2. Callback calls guessGrid.handleKeyPress()
  </action>
  <verify>grep -n "onKeyPress\|handleKeyPress" src/main.ts shows the connection</verify>
  <done>Keyboard click events properly forwarded to GuessGrid</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify action key styling exists</name>
  <files>src/style.css</files>
  <action>
    Confirm CSS includes styling for Enter and Backspace action keys:
    1. .key-action class with wider width
    2. Mobile responsive adjustments for action keys
  </action>
  <verify>grep -n "key-action" src/style.css shows styling rules</verify>
  <done>CSS styling for action keys (Enter/Backspace) is present</done>

  <what-built>
    Phase 12 already implemented Enter and Backspace keys on the on-screen keyboard.

    Existing implementation includes:
    - Enter key on left side of bottom row (full text "Enter")
    - Backspace key on right side of bottom row (with SVG delete icon)
    - Both keys are clickable and dispatch to the guess grid
    - Both keys have wider styling via .key-action class
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:5173
    3. Look at the on-screen keyboard at bottom of page
    4. Verify: Enter key is visible on left of bottom row
    5. Verify: Backspace key (with X icon) is visible on right of bottom row
    6. Test: Click letter keys to type a word
    7. Test: Click Backspace to delete letters
    8. Test: Type 5 letters, then click Enter to submit
    9. Confirm: Enter and Backspace keys function correctly
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if Enter/Backspace keys work, or describe any issues</resume-signal>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Keyboard.ts contains Enter and Backspace in ROWS array
- [ ] Keyboard.ts renders both keys with proper classes
- [ ] main.ts connects onKeyPress to guessGrid.handleKeyPress
- [ ] style.css has .key-action styling
- [ ] Visual verification: Enter and Backspace keys visible
- [ ] Functional verification: Both keys work when clicked
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Enter and Backspace keys exist on on-screen keyboard
- Clicking Enter submits the current row (when complete)
- Clicking Backspace deletes the last letter
- Keys are properly styled (wider than letter keys)
- Phase 16 requirements are satisfied by existing Phase 12 implementation
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/16-keyboard-enhancements/16-01-SUMMARY.md`

Note: This phase's work was already completed in Phase 12. The summary should document that Phase 16 was satisfied by prior work and required only verification.
